Ground Truth:
Sir Roy’s United Federal Party is boycotting the London talks on the Protectorate s
future. Said Mr. Nkumbula last night: ”We want to discuss what to do if the British
Government gives in to Sir Roy and the talks fall through. There are bound to be
demonstrations.” Yesterday Sir Roy’s chief aide, Mr. Julius Greenfield, telephoned
his chief a report on his talks with Mr. Macmillan at Chequers.
