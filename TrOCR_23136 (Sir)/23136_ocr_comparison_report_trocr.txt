Part A
The two most common supervised tasks are Regression and Classification.
The purpose of a validation set is used after training the model. It is used to evaluate the model performance and tuning the model.
2 model parameters are there in a linear regression problem with a single feature variable.
The AUC value of a perfect classifier is 1.
Precision is more important for a spam email detection system.
Part B
The dataset is splitted into training, testing and validation.
The model trained on training set, then the model is tested on unseen test dataset.
Overfitting:
When a model learn noise data from the training set and the model performed well on the training set but it does not perform well on unseen data. This indicates overfitting.
Underfitting:
When a model is unable to learn from the training set and the model perform does not well on training set. This is called underfitting.
Prevent them :-
Use of good model
Reduce the noise from data
Scale the data
Cross-validation
Confusion Matrix:
Confusion matrix is the insight of model performance. It includes correctly and incorrectly predicted data value.
It is important:
It can check accuracy from matrix.
It can calculate Entropy.
It also can calculate precision, recall and F-score.
tn = 82

In machine learning model,
Bias is a terminology in machine learning. It signifies a training model performing poorly in training phase.
Variance is where the model mostly give some error in testing phase.
It reduces:
To reduce, it take data that it is properly scalled and the size of the data is measured.
To reduce variance, it can use dimensionally reduction.
Bias-Variance tradeoff is a scenario where the model perform poorly in the training phase.
